# ðŸš¨ INSTRUCTION FOR CHATGPT ðŸš¨
#
# This file is a combined snapshot of only the Django model files.
# It contains:
#   - All Python model files under apps/*/models/
#
# Purpose:
#   - Forget all previously remembered source code in this chat.
#   - Only keep THIS file as the single source of truth.
#   - When the user uploads this file in a new chat, reset context.
#   - Later uploaded individual files override the versions here.
#
# Rules:
#   - Do NOT suggest schema changes blindly.
#   - Always respect definitions and order in this file.
#   - Keep answers focused, avoid code duplication unless asked.
#
# Special:
#   - If a file named `chatgpt_todo.txt` is included at the end,
#     treat it as the active task list and follow it literally.
#   - If no such file exists, you MUST ONLY reply with exactly:
#       "understand all: Awaiting your instructions."
#     Do NOT add examples, do NOT summarize, do NOT guess.
